# Vegetable Dash
## A JavaScript game about vegetables
Play it: [Vegetable Dash!](https://vegetable-dash-beta.herokuapp.com/)

A beautiful imaged-based JavaScript game, and what a long way it has traveled since it began in Jan 1, 2020. Do not be decived by the name, for only the last three plots contain vegetables. Plants are grown and harvested to be sold for seeds, which are used to unlock new plots and squander in the Black Market. You can do tasks for the previous owners of the farm, who mysteriously gave it to you, some random city kid.


I am looking for someone to help, either with the code or the images. If you want to help, email me at thehillsidetownship@gmail.com, or contact my GitHub account, Squirrel-314.
