### About
A beautiful imaged-based JavaScript game, and what a long way it has traveled since it began in Jan 1, 2020. Do not be decived by the name, for few of the plants grown are vegetables. Plants are grown and harvested to be sold for coins, which are used to unlock new plots and squander in the Black Market. You can do tasks for the previous owners of the farm, who mysteriously gave it to you, some random city kid.
